#[jonathanHirz.com](http://jonathanhirz.com) - simplification rewrite

Full rewrite of [my website](http://jonathanhirz.com) to focus on a place to host my games. My blog has been moved to tumblr ([blog.jonathanhirz.com](http://blog.jonathanhirz.com)) so this site can focus on one thing: my games.

I used only html, css and php to make this site. It is responsive and should look great on desktop, tablet and mobile phone screens. If it doesn't, oh well.

The games hosted here still need to be played on a desktop browser with either Flash or the Unity plugin installed.
